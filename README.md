# LineDesigner
# This is the first but not the last edition of UAV LineDesigner project. 
# This project calculates airlines based on intrinsic parameters of the sensor. 
# Inputs: the length of sides of target area (considering as a rectangle), 
#         the intrinsic parameters (f, x0, y0), 
#         the spatial resolution, 
#         the pixel size, 
# Outputs: the airlines, 
#          the flying height.
